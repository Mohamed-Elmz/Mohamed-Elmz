Identified insincere questions by combining Natural Language Processing methods (ie. tokenization and word embedding) with Machine Learning algorithms. Achieved a top 10th percentile ranking on Kaggle with an F1-score of 87.9, showcasing the classifier's effectiveness at identifying inflammatory posts. Most importantly, this analysis was part of Quora's initiative to improve the user experience and moderate posts ethically.

### Efficient Finacial Document Processing with LLM's

Developed an interpretable regression model to forecast high-yielding stocks and build a portfolio that outperforms the returns of the S&P 500 index. Using Large Language Model prompt engineering and machine learning pipelines on unstructured financial data, our model generated a 33 percent increase in cumulative and percentage return.
